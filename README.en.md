  <strong>🚀 Out-of-the-box, open-source, and free AI bid proposal writing tool focused on AI proposal writing, bid AI, and AI bid generation.</strong>
  <br>
  Yibiao Bid Toolbox is an intelligent bid document creation tool for tendering and bidding workflows. It is designed for proposal writers, presales engineers, project managers, and bid teams. The product covers the full workflow from importing tender documents to exporting editable Word proposals, including tender document parsing, scoring-point extraction, proposal outline generation, technical proposal drafting, expansion and rewriting, knowledge base reuse, duplicate-check workspace, and rejection-risk checklist workspace.

  If you are looking for a free AI proposal writing tool, bid AI assistant, AI bid generation software, tender response generator, or technical proposal drafting assistant, Yibiao can be used as an open-source reference to improve proposal writing efficiency and reduce the time spent on repetitive writing, manual scoring-point organization, and rejection-risk checks.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The current product is an independent desktop client under `client/`. It does not depend on the legacy `frontend/` or `backend/` structure.

- **Desktop**: Electron Main / Preload provides local file access, configuration, export, and background task capabilities.
- **Renderer**: Vite + React + TypeScript, with global CSS and Radix UI primitives.
- **Features**: Technical proposal, knowledge base, duplicate-check workspace, rejection-risk checklist workspace, and settings.
- **Local Data**: Configuration, workspace data, and generated caches are stored under Electron `userData`.
- **Packaging**: Built for Windows / macOS with electron-builder.
